# Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Study Guide

**üëã Welcome! üëã**

This repository contains a study guide created in preparation for passing the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam. It is a work in progress with regular updates being made via my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wahlnetwork) live streams. Each objective is broken down into helpful links, commands, videos, scripts, code samples, and more so that you can refer back to this guide during your studies.

The `main` branch contains all of the finished work, while the `draft` branch contains work-in-progress that needs to be polished, verified, and formatted.

I've made a brief announcement video that you can watch below:
